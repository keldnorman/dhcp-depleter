# Quick Start Guide

Get started with DHCP Depleter in under 5 minutes!

## Prerequisites

- ESP32-C6 development board
- USB cable
- Computer with PlatformIO installed
- Target WiFi network (that you own or have permission to test)

## Step 1: Install PlatformIO (2 minutes)

```bash
pip install platformio
```

Or install the PlatformIO extension in VS Code.

## Step 2: Build and Upload (3 minutes)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/keldnorman/dhcp-depleter.git
cd dhcp-depleter

# Connect your ESP32-C6 via USB

# Build and upload
pio run --target upload

# Monitor output (optional)
pio device monitor
```

## Step 3: Connect to Device (1 minute)

### Option A: Scan QR Code
1. Look at the serial monitor output
2. Use your phone's camera to scan the WiFi QR code

### Option B: Manual Connection
1. Open WiFi settings on your phone/laptop
2. Connect to network: **Sinkhole**
3. Password: **12345678**

## Step 4: Access Web Interface (1 minute)

1. Open a web browser
2. Navigate to: **http://10.13.37.1**
3. You should see the DHCP Depleter interface

## Step 5: Run Your First Test (2 minutes)

1. **Scan Networks**
   - Click "Scan WiFi Networks" button
   - Wait for the list to populate

2. **Select Target**
   - Choose your target network from the dropdown
   - Enter the WiFi password (if secured)

3. **Test Connection**
   - Click "Test Connection"
   - Wait for confirmation (shows assigned IP)

4. **Start Attack**
   - Click "Start Attack"
   - Watch the statistics update in real-time

5. **Monitor Results**
   - See addresses obtained count
   - View attack runtime
   - Try connecting another device to see the impact

6. **Stop Attack**
   - Click "Stop Attack" when done
   - Your network should recover after DHCP leases expire

## What to Expect

### First Run
- Device creates "Sinkhole" WiFi network
- Web interface loads immediately
- Network scan finds nearby WiFi

### During Attack
- New IP address every ~2 seconds
- Serial monitor shows each successful connection
- Target network's DHCP pool gradually depletes

### Success Indicators
- Counter shows increasing number of addresses
- New devices can't connect to target network
- DHCP pool becomes exhausted

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Connect to "Sinkhole"
- **Problem**: WiFi not showing up
- **Solution**: Check serial monitor for errors, try rebooting device

### Web Interface Won't Load
- **Problem**: Page not loading at 10.13.37.1
- **Solution**: Verify you're connected to "Sinkhole" WiFi

### Test Connection Fails
- **Problem**: Can't connect to target network
- **Solution**: Double-check WiFi password, ensure network is in range

### Attack Gets No Addresses
- **Problem**: Counter stays at 0
- **Solution**: Run "Test Connection" first, check serial monitor for errors

### Device Keeps Restarting
- **Problem**: Power brownouts
- **Solution**: Use better USB power supply or powered USB hub

## Next Steps

### Learn More
- Read the full [README.md](README.md) for detailed information
- Check [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for usage scenarios
- Review [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for legal guidelines

### Customize
- Modify AP name/password in `src/main.cpp`
- Adjust attack rate (default: 1 request/second)
- Change web interface styling

### Contribute
- Report bugs on GitHub
- Submit feature requests
- Contribute code improvements

## Safety Tips

‚ö†Ô∏è **Always remember:**

1. **Get Permission**: Only test networks you own or have authorization for
2. **Start Small**: Test on home network first to understand impact
3. **Monitor Impact**: Watch for unexpected consequences
4. **Have a Plan**: Know how to stop and restore normal operation
5. **Document Everything**: Keep records of your testing

## Common Scenarios

### Home Network Test (5 minutes)
```
1. Connect to Sinkhole
2. Scan and select your home WiFi
3. Test connection
4. Start attack
5. Try connecting a new device (should fail)
6. Stop attack
7. Wait for lease expiry or reboot router
```

### Lab Environment (10 minutes)
```
1. Set up isolated test network
2. Configure small DHCP pool (e.g., 10 addresses)
3. Run attack until pool exhausts
4. Document time to exhaustion
5. Test mitigation strategies
6. Verify attacks are blocked
```

## Performance Expectations

| Network Type | Expected Result |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Home Router** | Pool exhausted in 2-10 minutes |
| **Small Business** | Pool exhausted in 10-30 minutes |
| **Enterprise (unprotected)** | Pool exhausted in 30+ minutes |
| **Enterprise (protected)** | Attack blocked/rate limited |
